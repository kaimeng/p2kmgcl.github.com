I try to learn new things every day. I look for enjoying my job and improve myself both professionaly as personaly.

I like to follow Ubuntu's philosophy: If someone's good at something, is because he's surrounded by people that help him to be like he is. That's why when I reach a goal, the first I want to do is to share it with my friends, and besides, when a friend reachs a goal, I try to follow his steps. We are social beings, so we must support each other.

I am persevering, and I own an agile mind for learning new stuff quickly. When I arise a new goal, I always analyze how many ways are there to reach it before starting my path.

I'm Pablo Molina.
